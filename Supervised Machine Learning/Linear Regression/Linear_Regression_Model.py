# ## 2 -  Problem Statement
# 
# Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.
# - You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
# - The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
# - You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant. 
#     - For these cities, you have the city population.
#     
# Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits?

# load the dataset
x_train, y_train = load_data()


# View the variables

# print x_train
print("Type of x_train:",type(x_train))
print("First five elements of x_train are:\n", x_train[:5]) 

# x_train is a numpy array that contains decimal values that are all greater than zero.
# These values represent the city population times 10,000
# For example, 6.1101 means that the population for that city is 61,101
#   
# Now, let's print `y_train`

# print y_train
print("Type of y_train:",type(y_train))
print("First five elements of y_train are:\n", y_train[:5])  

# Similarly, `y_train` is a numpy array that has decimal values, some negative, some positive.
# - These represent your restaurant's average monthly profits in each city, in units of \$10,000.
#   - For example, 17.592 represents \$175,920 in average monthly profits for that city.
#   - -2.6807 represents -\$26,807 in average monthly loss for that city.

# #### Check the dimensions of your variables

print ('The shape of x_train is:', x_train.shape)
print ('The shape of y_train is: ', y_train.shape)
